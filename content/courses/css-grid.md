desc: "CSS Grid is a brand new layout system in CSS! It's not a framework or library - it's an addition to the language that allows us to quickly create flexible, two dimensional layouts. We can use it to place, size, align and architect designs that were previously difficult or even impossible with floats or flexbox. CSS Grid may seem a bit daunting with new syntax and layout ideas, but it's fairly simple and can be broken down into a handful of powerful concepts that when used together will blow your mind and change the way you create layouts for the web forever."
