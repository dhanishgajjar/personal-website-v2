desc: "A rock solid understanding of JavaScript is essential for success, no matter which framework you use. This course will give you that. JavaScript is hard to learn. Frustration, abandonment and rage quits all stem from trying to use something when we don't understand how things work. Being able to make your ideas is a super power. Invest in a solid base and you'll slam dunk anything that comes your way."
