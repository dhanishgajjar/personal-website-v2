desc: "Learn to build applications and APIs with Node.js
Node.js, Express, MongoDB and friends are some of the most in-demand web development skills. This course is the cumulation of everything I've learned building dozens of Node.js applications over the past five years. With a focus on modern JavaScript and real world application, Learn Node is an efficient way to add server side JavaScript to your skill-set and start building the applications you have been dreaming about."
