# About

Hello üëãüèΩ my name is Dhanish Gajjar. I‚Äôm a developer advocate and full stack developer at [Revieve Inc](https://www.revieve.com). I joined them in September 2017 and I‚Äôm still working there, loving every single day of it.

I primarily work with JavaScript, which means React, GatsbyJS, NextJS, NodeJS etc. Although I‚Äôm always learning new frameworks and technologies. I subscribe to the ‚ÄúJunior Dev for Life‚Äù mentality, we‚Äôre always learning.

If you want to get in touch with me, my social media links are on the home page.

## Backstory

I have a BA Hons. Degree, majoring in Economics and Statistics. Other than that I only did a small 6 month diploma course, where they taught how to use Photoshop, Dreamweaver, 3D Studio Max, DOS based 2D Animator Pro, Flash etc.

I was never creatively trained.

Before this I was a designer since 2005. I have worked with companies big and small as an employee and as a freelancer in that time. I started out as a graphics designer making print ads for magazines and newspapers. Then moved on to designing and developing websites.

There was a time when I even worked with architects and builders. I made 3D renderings for their projects, sometimes websites and marketing materials too.

When the iPhone SDK launched in 2008, I knew it was going to be huge, so I shifted my focus to UI / UX and worked with several startups on iPhone and iPad apps.

It was in 2016, I was working for an American startup and after about the first 5 months they fired me without any reason. That pushed me into depression, but after months of carefully thinking over it, I realised it was a good thing. I shuffled through my memories trying to find what made me fall in love with computers in the first place. And there, it came screaming back to me. It was 1994 at the age of 9 when I saw the beige boxes with black and white screen and you could write BASIC programs and make them do anything.

This was the time I decided I want to start teaching myself how to code. Which I never did in all those years. So I got started with online courses. But I found myself doing these courses alone, I had no social media presence, nor was I a part of any community. I started posting what I was learning on Instagram (It seemed less daunting than Twitter, where all the Pro devs hung out).

Surprisingly I started getting lots of followers, and along with followers I got feedback, I got more questions from other people who were just beginning. Unknowingly I had created my own community on Instagram. I used to post everyday and after about 6 months I started applying for junior developer jobs in Lisbon. I got rejected from every single one of them. I had no CS degree or a bootcamp certificate. I felt a bit demotivated.

I used to get DMs on Instagram all the time and sometimes people trying to ask me if I was available for freelance work, I used to deny them or just delete them. Most seemed like blank accounts, not real and that often happens online. People trying to get free work. But there was this one DM I thought let me give it a try.

They were asking for a quote and I emailed them back saying I would prefer a full time role, if their project was long. The person said he will call me on Skype the next day and he did. We discussed everything and he introduced me to what the company was doing, so I asked when is the interview. He said there is no interview, everything you do I have been watching on your instagram, how you come across problems, how you post them, how you find solutions and fix them, that‚Äôs enough for me. Just like that, I was hired by [Samuli Siivinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samulisiivinen/).

I am still working there and we've grown from a team of 6 to more than 60 people today. It‚Äôs been an incredible journey. Samuli has been an amazing mentor, manager and CTO.
