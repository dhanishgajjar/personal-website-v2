Hello üëãüèΩ my name is Dhanish Gajjar. I'm a developer advocate and full-stack developer at [Revieve Inc](https://www.revieve.com). I joined them in September 2017, and I'm still working there, loving every single day of it.

I primarily work with JavaScript, which means React, GatsbyJS, NextJS, NodeJS, etc. Although I'm always learning new frameworks and technologies. I subscribe to the "Junior Dev for Life" mentality. We're always learning.

My social media links are on the home page if you want to contact me.
