# About

Hello üëãüèΩ my name is Dhanish Gajjar. I‚Äôm a developer advocate and full stack developer at [Revieve Inc](https://www.revieve.com). I joined them in September 2017 and I‚Äôm still working there, loving every single day of it.

I primarily work with JavaScript, which means React, GatsbyJS, NextJS, NodeJS etc. Although I‚Äôm always learning new frameworks and technologies. I subscribe to the ‚ÄúJunior Dev for Life‚Äù mentality, we‚Äôre always learning.

If you want to get in touch with me, my social media links are on the home page.

## Backstory, and how I got here.

I have a BA Hons. Degree, majoring in Economics and Statistics. Other than that I only did a small 6 month diploma course, where they taught how to use Photoshop, Dreamweaver, 3D Studio Max, DOS based 2D Animator Pro, Flash etc.

I started out as a graphics designer making print ads for magazines and newspapers. Then moved on to designing and developing websites. I didn't know HTML, CSS or JS back then. The way I learned at my first company was to take a Photoshop file and slice the entire design. For example this is the navigation, this is where the text would go. You turn of all the text and then export this collection of slices to a HTML folder. You then open the file in dreamweaver, all the spots where text would go, you delete that image and place it again as a background. Then type out the text. Everything was done in a visual mode. This was so wrong, but it worked!. We only had to care about one screen size and 2 browsers, Internet Explorer and Firefox.

There was a time when I even worked with architects and builders. I made 3D renderings for their projects, sometimes websites and marketing materials too.

When the iPhone SDK launched in 2008, I knew it was going to be huge, so I shifted my focus to UI / UX and worked with several startups on iPhone and iPad apps.

It was in 2016 and I was working for an American startup. After about the first 5 months they fired me without any reason. That pushed me into depression, it was the first time I was ever fired from anything. After months of carefully thinking over it, I realised I was doing all this for almost 12 years, and I don't enjoy it anymore.

It was a good thing that I was fired. I shuffled through my memories trying to find what made me fall in love with computers in the first place. And there, it came screaming back to me. It was 1994 at the age of 9 when I saw the beige boxes with black and white screen and you could write BASIC programs and make them do anything. But unfortunately due to life circumstances I was never able to own a computer until I was 21 and it was 2004.

So I decided I want to start teaching myself how to code. Which I never did in all those years. I got started with online courses, I had no social media presence, nor was I a part of any community so I always felt alone. I started posting what I was learning on Instagram (It seemed less daunting than Twitter, where all the Pro devs hung out).

Surprisingly I started getting lots of followers, and along with followers I got feedback, I got more questions from other people who were just beginning. Unknowingly I had created my own community on Instagram. I wanted to be a guide and a mentor to all these folks, which I never had. At least point them in the right direction and give them all the resources they would need to make their own decision.

After about 6 months I started applying for junior developer jobs in Lisbon. I got rejected from every single one of them. I had no CS degree or a bootcamp certificate. I felt a bit demotivated. I was in my mid 30s and I didn't know how long will it take for me to learn everything to get my first job. Then something magical happened.

I used to get DMs on Instagram all the time and sometimes people trying to ask me if I was available for freelance work, I used to deny them or just delete them. Most seemed like blank accounts, not real and that often happens online. People trying to get free work. But there was this one DM I thought let me give it a try.

They were asking for a quote and I emailed them back saying I would prefer a full time role, if their project was long. The person said he will call me on Skype the next day and he did. We discussed everything and he introduced me to what the company was doing, so I asked when is the interview. He said there is no interview, everything you do I have been watching on your instagram, how you come across problems, how you post them, how you find solutions and fix them, that‚Äôs enough for me. Just like that, I was hired by [Samuli Siivinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samulisiivinen/).

I am still working there and we've grown from a team of 6 to more than 60 people today. It‚Äôs been an incredible journey. Samuli has been an amazing mentor, manager and CTO.
